        <mark>Prehistoric medicine refers to medicine before humans were able to read and write. It covers a vast period
          and varies, according to regions of the world and cultures. Anthropologists study the history of humanity and
          have yet to discover exactly how people practiced medicine in prehistoric times.
          <br><br>We know that prehistoric men successfully carried out some operations. One of these is trephining.
          This operation involves cutting a disk out of the skull of a persons head. Whilst we can’t be 100% sure why
          they did this, we do know that people survived this type of operation – there is evidence of bone growth on
          skulls that have been operated on!</mark>

        <mark>The ancient Egyptians had a system of medicine that was very advanced for its time and influenced later
          medical traditions. The Egyptians and Babylonians both introduced the concepts of diagnosis, prognosis, and
          medical examination. They provided modern historians with a great deal of knowledge and evidence about their
          attitude towards medicine and the medical knowledge that they had. This evidence has come from the numerous
          papyruses found in archaeological searches. Like prehistoric man, some of the beliefs of the Egyptians were
          based on myths and legend. However, their knowledge was also based on an increasing knowledge of the human
          anatomy and plain commonsense. Healers became known as physicians or doctors.</mark>

        <mark>Acupuncture and Chinese herbal remedies date back at least 2,200 years, although the earliest known
          written record of Chinese medicine is the Huangdi neijing (The Yellow Emperor’s Inner Classic) from the 3rd
          century BCE. That opus provided the theoretical concepts for TCM that remain the basis of its practice today.
          <br><br> It is based on the belief that qi (the body's vital energy) flows along meridians (channels) in the
          body and keeps a person’s spiritual, emotional, mental, and physical health in balance. Traditional Chinese
          medicine aims to restore the body’s balance and harmony between the natural opposing forces of yin and yang,
          which can block qi and cause disease.</mark>

        <mark>Ancient Greek medicine began to revolve around the theory of humors. The humoral theory states that good
          health comes from a perfect balance of the four humors: blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile.
          Consequently, poor health resulted from improper balance of the four humors. Hippocrates, known as the "Father
          of Modern Medicine", established a medical school at Cos and is the most important figure in ancient Greek
          medicine. Hippocrates and his students documented numerous illnesses in the Hippocratic Corpus, and developed
          the Hippocratic Oath for physicians, which is still in use today. He and his students also created medical
          terminology that is part of our vocabulary today. Medical words included acute, chronic, epidemic,
          exacerbation, relapse, and others. The contributions to ancient Greek medicine of Hippocrates, Socrates and
          others had a lasting influence on Islamic medicine and medieval European medicine until many of their findings
          eventually became obsolete in the 14th century.</mark>

        <mark>Medieval medicine is widely misunderstood, thought of as a uniform attitude composed of placing hopes in
          the church and God to heal all sicknesses, while sickness itself exists as a product of destiny, sin, and
          astral influences as physical causes. On the other hand, medieval medicine, especially in the second half of
          the medieval period (c. 1100–1500 AD), became a formal body of theoretical knowledge and was institutionalized
          in the universities. Medieval medicine attributed illnesses, and disease, not to sinful behaviour, but to
          natural causes, and sin was connected to illness only in a more general sense of the view that disease
          manifested in humanity as a result of its fallen state from God.
          <br><br>The Middle Ages contributed a great deal to medical knowledge. This period contained progress in
          surgery, medical chemistry, dissection, and practical medicine. The Middle Ages laid the ground work for
          later, more significant discoveries.</mark>

          The Renaissance in the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries was much more than just a reviving of interest in Greek
          and Roman culture; it was rather a change of outlook, an eagerness for discovery, a desire to escape from the
          limitations of tradition and to explore new fields of thought and action. In medicine, it was perhaps natural
          that anatomy and physiology, the knowledge of the human body and its workings, should be the first aspects of
          medical learning to receive attention from those who realized the need for reform.
          <br><br>
          In 1543 that Andreas Vesalius, a young Belgian professor of anatomy at the University of Padua, published
          De humani corporis fabrica (“On the Structure of the Human Body”), this seminal work corrected many of
          Galen’s. By his scientific observations and methods, Vesalius showed that Galen could no longer be regarded as
          the final authority. His work at Padua was continued by Gabriel Fallopius and, later, by Hieronymus Fabricius
          ab Aquapendente
          errors. </mark>

        <mark>The 17th century brought about significant changes and advancements in medicine. Despite the church's ban
          on dissection, the publication of Vesalius of Brussels's illustrated medical manual "On the Structure of the
          Human Body" allowed doctors to learn about the workings of the human body through secret dissections. The
          illustrations were so accurate that it became a vital guide for doctors and surgeons. Moreover, the rise of
          atomism and the scientific movement contributed to the development of medicine. William Harvey's discovery
          that blood circulates around the body, for instance, was a game-changer. Other breakthroughs include the
          introduction of new remedies like cinchona bark and the discovery of new diseases like rickets. The printing
          press allowed medical textbooks to be produced more cheaply and disseminated more rapidly. These developments
          paved the way for modern medicine.</mark>

        <mark>The 18th century was a period of medical progress and breakthroughs. Edward Jenner's development of the
          first ever vaccine in 1796 was a major achievement, as was John Hunter's work in observation, experimentation,
          and immunology. The gin craze during this period impacted people's well-being, leading to the development of
          more hospitals and institutions built by philanthropists, and the government's growing interest in public
          health. William Cullen's ideas, including his theory of nervous energy, were also influential in the
          development of medicine. The beginning of the 18th century saw the founding of many new schools north of the
          Alps, which led to a more competitive educational landscape. Colonial physicians, following the models in
          England and Scotland, introduced modern medicine to the cities, allowing for some advances in vaccination,
          pathology, anatomy, and pharmacology. While the 18th century did not see as many revolutionary breakthroughs
          as the 17th century, it was a period of progress that laid the foundation for modern medicine. </mark>

        <mark>The 19th century was a period of seismic change in medicine, with many advances that continue to benefit
          us today. The century saw the development of foundational principles of modern medicine, such as Germ Theory
          and sterilization, which revolutionized medical knowledge. The invention of key diagnostic tools commonly used
          by doctors today, such as the stethoscope, was also a significant advancement. The 19th century also saw huge
          shifts in scientific understanding, with great leaps made in medical procedures, equipment, and knowledge of
          how the body worked. One of the most important medical breakthroughs of the century was Louis Pasteur's
          discovery that germs cause disease, which led to the development of antitoxins and vaccinations against
          diseases like diphtheria, cholera, and anthrax. The 19th century also saw the first uses of chloroform and
          nitrous dioxides as anesthesia, important discoveries in regards to pathology and the perfection of the
          autopsy, and advances in our understanding of the human body.</mark>

        <mark>The 20th century saw a lot of progress in medicine, including dramatic increases in life expectancy, and a
          shift in focus from mortality to morbidity. The century brought about a wave of medical breakthroughs,
          including groundbreaking discoveries in endocrinology, nutrition, and other areas. The chemotherapeutic era
          was inaugurated by Paul Ehrlich in 1910 with the discovery of arsphenamine, which revolutionized the treatment
          and control of infectious diseases. In addition to these discoveries, the rapid progress of medicine in this
          era was reinforced by enormous improvements in communication between scientists throughout the world, which

          antibiotics to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Artificial organs and prosthetics have also seen
          significant advancements, allowing for greater control and functionality for patients. These advancements in
